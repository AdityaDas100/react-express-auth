A full-stack authentication app built with React, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.
This project provides secure user registration, login, protected routes, and token-based re-authentication — a complete boilerplate for any production-grade MERN project.


✅ User Registration — Secure signup with hashed passwords
✅ User Login — Generates a JWT for authenticated sessions
✅ Protected Routes — Accessible only with valid JWT
✅ Token Verification — Re-login / auto-login handled via stored token
✅ Logout — Clears stored token and session
✅ Express Middleware — Centralized auth validation
✅ Responsive Frontend — Built using React hooks and router navigation
✅ Persistent Login State — Maintains user state across refreshes
